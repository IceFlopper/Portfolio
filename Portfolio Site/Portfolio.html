                            I believe making things intuitive in terms of design is something I already know well, I always question "would this work for the end user?" and if not I change it.

                            Making this website, I realised I have a pretty good understanding of the language HTML and CSS, but I often find it hard to figure out what I want to actually put somewhere, I try to stand out as much as I can even if it backfires which is probably the biggest issue since I don't really know how what someone else finds appealing as I mostly listen to my own judgement.

                            Creating my cookie clicker, I believe I was able to once again create a very functional and useful User Interface, but it wasn't the prettiest partly because it was not designed to be pretty and partly because I was more focused on the actual code and making the back-end work, so I couldn't be bothered making the front end up to the same standard.

                            Recreating the Sony Site for Web Essentials, This I was good at in fact I was ahead of my class and even found it too easy, I realised when faced with a design that I have to recreate I know exactly what I need to do and how I need to do it, ofcourse I do forget certain paramaters and other things in HTML that I barely use but that is a rare issue.

                            I need to make sure I rely less on internet tools and more on my own knowledge, it's easier said than done specially because I have never had any experience of any kind in any sort of programming so this is all entirely new to me, but I am trying my best to become better.

                    <h4>My Task:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Create a cookie clicker based off the popular game.
                    </p>
                    <h4>My Challenges:</h4>
                    <p>
                        At first I wasn't even sure how to begin, I was happy when my cookie gave me a cookie when I clicked on it, but soon it expanded into a much more complex and complicated problem.
                        <br>
                        I ended up with over 2500 lines of C# which I know could certainly be reduced to a thousand, but I simply don't have to skill or experience to do so.
                        <br>
                        But I do know one thing, it works, and it works exactly how I want it to (except for the weird 0 0 0 at the end of my numbers, my formatter doesn't work properly.)
                    </p>
                    <h4>What i learnt:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Roughly how to code C# and why it's not easy.
                        <br>
                        I came in to this project with 0 clue on how to even begin and ended up with a very functional clicker that I think has no bugs, so I do think I learnt something.

            <h4>Curiosity</h4>
            <p>
                I've always been interested in the way things around me work. Therefore, it's only natural that I gained an interest in the ways the software and hardware work that I interact with every single day. From entertainment to serious work, it's always been a part of my daily routine to use the software programmed and designed by developers.
            </p>
            <h4>Gaming</h4>
            <p>Gaming has always been a big influence in my life and an interest in becoming some kind of developer. I love the idea of shaping my own worlds and working together on a project with a team full of diverse and creative people. My mind has been filled with ideas ever since I've been a kid, trying to find the next cool thing, and I was always met with the same realization that nobody else seems to have the same idea and passion for quality these days. So, even though this may be a far-fetched dream from where I am now, it's only up from here.
            </p>
            <h4>People</h4>
            <p>I always strive to make others happy and satisfied as a worker. I go out of my way to make sure they get what they need and want, and try to do extra just in case to make sure they are satisfied. I do it because I genuinely enjoy it. Seeing the smile light up on someone's face when I find the item they need out of the racks in the grocery store or when I fix something that was broken has always driven me to be the best version of myself. I'm the same when it comes to software and hardware, driven by the same moral. I want to make sure people have a properly working bug-free experience and a good quality of life experience too. Having been an avid early access player for many games, I know what it's like to play buggy messes and interact with horrible UI, and I would love to participate in reducing these things.
